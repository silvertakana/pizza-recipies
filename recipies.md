Preheat the oven to 200°C.
Place the slices of red onion on a baking tray and drizzle with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Roast for 15 minutes or until slightly charred. Remove from the oven and set aside.
Increase the oven temperature to 250°C.
Spread the tomato paste over the pizza base. Sprinkle over ¾ of the Perfect Pizza to evenly cover the base. Top with the pancetta, broccolini, olives, balsamic red onion and the remainder of the Perfect Pizza.

Serve immediately.
